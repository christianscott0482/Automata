# Automata
This repository contains all the homewoks for Christian Auspland in the class COS451 at the University of Maine in Spring of 2018. Most homeworks are built off previous homeworks in extending a lexaard parser for finite state automata(FSA) both deterministic(DFA) and nondeterministic(NFA), regular expressions(regex),  and context free grammars(CFG).
