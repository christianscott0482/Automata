3 Tasks

1. Add PDA functionality to define and print methods. To call define:
	define pda_name pda
define calls the define method. pda_name is the name of the new pda and pda tells the program that you're making a pda as opposed to a dfa or cfg

To Print:
	print pda_name
print calls the print method, and prints the state machine in pda_name (hopefully a pda in this case). 

2. Include cfg2pda function.

3. Include pda2cfg function.
