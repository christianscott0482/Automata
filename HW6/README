3 Tasks

1. Add PDA functionality to define and print methods. To call define:
	define pda_name pda
define calls the define method. pda_name is the name of the new pda and pda tells the program that you're making a pda as opposed to a dfa or cfg

To Print:
	print pda_name
print calls the print method, and prints the state machine in pda_name (hopefully a pda in this case). 


example use:
define myPDA pda
description
0 1 ..
0 $ ..
*q1 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. q2,$
q2 .. .. q2,0 q3,.. .. .. .. .. ..
q3 .. .. .. q3,.. .. .. .. q4,.. ..  
*q4 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

print m

2. Include cfg2pda function.
define a cfg with the following format
define g cfg
description
A -> 0 A 1
A -> B
B -> #

then call the conversion as
define m cfg2pda g

finally we can print with
print m
