Homework 5

This homework adds compatibility to use CFGs, specifically with the
print and define statements. They are used as follows:
print name // name here is the name of a predefined cfg

define name cfg // where name is the name of a predefined cfg
//From here three kinds of lines are availabale. First:
h -> b1 b2 .. bp // rule of variable h with a terminal string on the right
// NOTE: Variables are assumed to always be one character
v1 v2 v3 ... vp // A list of variables
.. t1 t2 ... tp // A list  of terminals
// NOTE: '..' is the indicator that the list of terminals
// and not variables

The define loop will run continuously until two consecutive newline
characters are read and the loop finishes.
