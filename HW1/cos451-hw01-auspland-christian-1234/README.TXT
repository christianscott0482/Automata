Project: Homework 1
Author: Christian Auspland


This project takes a string input in the form of parenthesized single and linked vertices that form a graph.
The string for the graph is sorted and stored in a usable form, in this case an array list of a class of custom vertices
that hold a character name and character array of other vertices that it is connected to. All the vertices are 
put into an algorithm that finds the cliques and anti-cliques of the graph and outputs them with the appropriate 
formatting.
